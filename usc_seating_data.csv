Kevin,Murphy,USC,Finance,No,,"Finance theory says that companies in declining industries with excess capacity should transfer capital to other sectors of the economy to preserve value, yet this has proven very difficult for firms in such situations to do. The authors showcase a particularly successful case involving defense contractor General Dynamics and explain why that company was so successful at something very few other companies have achieved.

Faced with very poor prospects for the defense industry, GD increased the wealth of its shareholders by more than 500% in the three years from January 1, 1990, when sharp defense spending cuts were confirmed after the end of the Cold War, to January 1993. The downsizing, restructuring, and partial liquidation of General Dynamics was a remarkable economic achievement in three important respects. First, managing effectively in a declining business environment required dramatic changes in traditional corporate policies, particularly compensation policies. Second, GD's operating changes had to be closely coordinated with a series of complicated corporate financial transactions that were unprecedented for GD. Third, senior management had to confront extraordinary public relations, political, and labor union challenges. The successful plan involved providing high-powered and front-loaded equity incentives for the (largely new) GD senior management team, asset sales, radically lower capex budgets, sharply higher dividends, and aggressive share repurchases. And although many GD employees lost their jobs (or went to different companies), GD shareholders, including many of those same GD employees, ended up handsomely rewarded.","We study relationships between parties who have different preferences about how to tailor decisions to changing circumstances. Our model suggests that relational contracts supported by formal contracts may achieve relational adaptation that improves on adaptation decisions achieved by formal or relational contracts alone. Our empirics consider revenue-sharing contracts between movie distributors and an exhibitor. The exhibitor has discretion about whether and when to show a movie, and the parties frequently renegotiate formal contracts after a movie has finished its run. We document that such ex post renegotiation is consistent with the distributor rewarding the exhibitor for adaptation decisions that improve their joint payoffs.","We provide fresh evidence regarding the relation between compensation consultants and CEO pay. First, firms that employ consultants have higher-paid CEOs—this result is robust to firm fixed effects and matching on economic and governance variables. Second, while this relation is partly due to consultant conflicts of interest, it is largely explained by the impact consultants have on the composition and complexity of CEO pay plans; notably, this impact fully mediates the consultant-CEO pay relation. Third, firms with higher-paid CEOs and more complex pay plans are more likely to hire a consultant. Last, Say-on-Pay voting patterns suggest shareholders view positively the advice consultants provide, but only when consultants provide no other services. We also find suggestive evidence of boards “layering” new equity incentive plans over existing ones, thereby increasing the impact of composition and complexity on CEO pay beyond the premium the CEO would demand for bearing additional compensation risk.",,
Robert,Dittmar,University of Michigan,Finance,No,Asset pricing,"We conduct a systematic examination of the returns to initial coin offerings (ICOs) throughout the hype cycle using hand-compiled data on all trading ICOs from 2014 to 2019. We demonstrate that ICOs persistently outperform non-ICO cryptocurrencies during both the market boom and crash. We then uncover significant return determinants in the cross section along both informational and behavioral dimensions, and document significant differences in their return association in the post-hype period from late 2018 onward. Our results position ICOs as a unique asset class with features from both reward-based crowdfunding and equities, and the crowdfunding features become more dominant post-hype.","We investigate the empirical implications of the investment-based model of asset pricing for the Hansen-Jagannathan and Kozak-Nagel-Santosh discount factors in the linear span of equity returns. We find that the stochastic discount factors satisfying the Euler equation for equity returns cannot satisfy the Euler equation for investment returns because returns on corporate investment covary inversely with sources of equity risk relative to returns on equity. As a result, the model fails to replicate the level of the risk premium. Our results suggest that joint restrictions on the optimality of investment and consumption pose stringent conditions for candidate production models.","We propose a novel method of estimating default probabilities using equity options data. The resulting default probabilities are highly correlated with estimates of default probabilities extracted from CDS spreads, which assume constant losses given default. Additionally, the option-implied default probabilities are higher in bad economic times and for firms with poorer credit ratings and financial positions. A simple inferred measure of loss given default is related to underlying business conditions, and varies across sectors; the time series properties of this measure are similar after controlling for liquidity effects.",,

This result is confirmed using the initiation of connecting flights through recently opened air hubs because investment at destinations served by these connecting flights increases after, not before, their initiation. Air travel also broadens the investor base of firms and lowers their cost of equity by approximately 1%. Overall, air travel improves the diversification of investor portfolios and lowers the cost of equity for firms.","We find evidence of taste‐based discrimination against rival affiliations in the online market for rental accommodation. Airbnb hosts in college towns increase their listing prices more than hotels on home football games against rival teams. By setting listing prices too high as a result of their affiliation bias against rival fans, hosts experience a 30% reduction in rental income. The overestimation of demand, the cost (inconvenience) of temporary relocation, and the likelihood of incurring damage cannot explain the inverse relation between listing price increases, and rental incomes that is limited to games against rival teams. Instead, greater financial constraints are associated with smaller listing price increases, and higher rental incomes on rival games, suggesting that taste‐based discrimination is a luxury.","Informal risk sharing within social networks and formal financial contracts both enable households to manage risk. We find that financial contracting reduces participation in social networks. Specifically, increased crop insurance usage decreased local religious adherence and congregation membership in agricultural communities. Our identification utilizes the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 that doubled crop insurance usage nationally within a year, although changes in usage varied across counties. Difference-in-Difference and Spatial First Difference tests confirm that households substituted insurance for religiosity. This substitution was associated with reductions in crop diversification and crop yields, indicating an increase in moral hazard.",,
William,Mullins,UC San Diego,Finance,No,"Finance, Corporate and Household finance, political economy","We find evidence of selective exposure to confirmatory information among 400,000 users on the investor social network StockTwits. Self-described bulls are 5 times more likely to follow a user with a bullish view of the same stock than self-described bears. Consequently, bulls see 62 more bullish messages and 24 fewer bearish messages than bears over the same 50-day period. These “echo chambers” exist even among professional investors and are strongest for investors who trade on their beliefs. Finally, beliefs formed in echo chambers are associated with lower ex-post returns, more siloing of information and more trading volume.","We use party-identifying language—like “liberal media” and “MAGA”—to identify Republican users on the investor social platform StockTwits. Using a difference-in-difference design, we find that partisan Republicans remain relatively unfazed in their beliefs about equities during the COVID-19 pandemic, while other users become considerably more pessimistic. In cross-sectional tests, we find Republicans become relatively more optimistic about stocks that suffered the most during the COVID-19 crisis, but more pessimistic about Chinese stocks. Finally, stocks with the greatest partisan disagreement on StockTwits have significantly more trading in the broader market, explaining 28% of the increase in stock turnover during the pandemic.","Using a survey of 800 Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in 22 emerging economies, we show that CEOs' management styles and philosophies vary with the ownership and governance structure of their firms. Founders and CEOs of firms with greater family involvement display a greater stakeholder focus, and feel more accountable to employees and banks than to shareholders. They also have a more hierarchical management approach, and see their role as maintaining the status quo rather than bringing about change. In contrast, CEOs of non-family firms emphasize shareholder-value-maximization. Finally, firm-level variation in ownership is as important in explaining management philosophies as cross-country or industry-level differences.",,
Stan,Markov,UT Dallas,Accounting,No,"social media, big data, market efficiency,\","We examine how increased competition stemming from an innovation in financial technology influences sell-side analyst research quality. We find that firms added to Estimize, an open platform that crowdsources short-term earnings forecasts, experience a pervasive and substantial reduction in consensus bias and a limited increase in consensus accuracy relative to matched control firms. Long-term forecasts and investment recommendations remain similarly biased, alleviating the concern that the documented reduction in bias is a response to broad economic forces. At the individual analyst level, we find that bias reduction is more pronounced among close-to-management analysts; and that more biased analysts respond by reducing their coverage of Estimize firms. The collective evidence suggests that competition from Estimize improves sell-side research quality by discouraging strategic bias.","We use employee predictions of their companies' six-month business outlook from Glassdoor.com to assess the information content of employee social media disclosures. We find that average employee outlook is incrementally informative in predicting future operating performance. Its information content is greater when the disclosures are aggregated from a larger, more diverse, more knowledgeable employee base, consistent with the wisdom of crowds phenomenon. Average outlook predicts bad news events more strongly than good news events, suggesting that employee social media disclosures are relatively more important as a source of bad news. Consistent with the organizational theory, we find systematic differences in the quantity and nature of the information in employee disclosures when the disclosures are grouped based on employee attributes and job responsibilities. Finally, average outlook predicts future returns of firms that attract less attention by analysts and investors, suggesting that investors in these firms use outlook inefficiently.","We study the effects of social media on the informativeness of retail trading. Our identification strategy exploits the editorial delay between report submission and publication on Seeking Alpha, a popular crowdsourced investment research platform. We find the ability of retail order imbalances to predict the cross-section of stock returns and cash-flow news increases sharply in the intraday post-publication window relative to the pre-publication window. The findings are robust to controlling for report tone and stronger for reports authored by more capable contributors. The evidence suggests that recent technology-enabled innovations in how individuals share information help retail investors become better informed.",,
Bryce,Schonberger,University of Colorado Boulder,Accounting,No,Network science and metrics; Information diffusion; Causal inference,"Existing research finds evidence in favor of a bidirectional causal relation between disclosure and features of the firm’s information environment, such that disclosure is both a determinant and an outcome of a firm’s information environment. Building on this idea, we use data envelopment analysis (DEA) to develop measures of the mapping between a firm’s portfolio of disclosures and the quality of the firm’s information environment. This approach shows that disclosure mapping scores vary predictably across firms based on sources of disclosure costs and display substantial persistence across time, consistent with enduring features of the operating environment determining firms’ disclosure strategies. Using these disclosure mapping scores, we examine whether unexpected shifts in the information environment from sources external to the firm, such as a loss of analyst coverage due to a brokerage closure, result in transitory or more permanent shifts in the firm-level mapping between disclosures and the information environment. Evidence from these tests suggests that firms dynamically adjust their disclosure portfolios toward a target mapping between disclosures and the information environment in response to events that move firms away from their target.","This study assesses whether the accrual-generating process is adequately described by a linear model with respect to a range of underlying determinants examined by prior literature. We document substantial departures from linearity across the distributions of accrual determinants, including measures of size, performance, and growth. To incorporate non-linear relations, we employ a recently developed multivariate matching approach (entropy balancing) to adjust for determinants in place of relying on a linear model. Entropy balancing identifies weights for the control sample to equalize the distribution of determinants across treatment and control samples. In simulations drawing random samples from deciles where a linear model displays poor fit, we find that entropy balancing significantly improves accrual model specification by reducing coefficient bias relative to linear and propensity-score matched models …","We exploit the US shale oil revolution in the early 2010s as a plausibly exogenous shock to investment opportunities to explore managers’ disclosure incentives when faced with an uncertain investment decision. We find that affected firms in the oil and gas (O&G) industry increase capital expenditure forecasts while decreasing earnings forecasts relative to similar, capital-intensive firms outside of the O&G industry. Consistent with these disclosure patterns reflecting incentives to encourage the incorporation of private information into prices that is useful for the investment decision, cross-sectional tests show that these disclosure changes are concentrated at firms with greater expected benefits to learning from prices and that disclosing firms subsequently experience increases in both investment-q sensitivity and adverse selection costs. On the other hand, we also find that a subset of O&G firms increases their provision of earnings forecasts during the shale oil revolution consistent with a financing motive. This subsample displays an increase in equity financing combined with a decline in investment-q sensitivity, consistent with firms trading off a benefit of improved stock liquidity against less informative prices. Taken together, our evidence points to distinct cost and benefit tradeoffs in managers’ disclosure decisions under learning and financing incentives in the presence of investment opportunities.",,
Christina,Synn,American University,Accounting,No,"Corporate disclosure, financial reporting, investor sentiment and beliefs","We investigate the role of financial reporting quality in reducing a firm’s over-and underleverage problem. Prior research suggests that due to financing frictions arising from adverse selection concerns, firms’ observed capital structure deviates from the optimal. Building off a large literature that provides evidence that financial reporting quality can mitigate adverse selection concerns and reduce financing frictions, we find evidence that a firm’s deviation from models of optimal capital structure is decreasing in financial reporting quality and that these results are larger in magnitude for the overleverage side.",,,,
Shane,Heitzman,USC,Accounting,No,"financial crime, tax","Theory provides competing predictions on whether informed investors immediately trade on newly generated private information. We address this question using Securities and Exchange Commission–mandated disclosures to identify the dates when new private information about target or acquiring firm value is created. We find that informed investors immediately trade on new private information in both the stock and options markets. Next, we investigate which factors drive the speed of these investors’ trading reactions to newly generated private information. We show that cross-sectional variation in the speed of their trading reactions can be explained by the number of privately informed investors, institutional ownership, the expected profits from informed trading and associated risk of attracting the attention of enforcement agencies, and the existence of public information about the acquisition deal.","We use financial disclosures to develop a novel proxy for net operating loss carryforward (NOL) tax benefits. This approach more accurately identifies firms with tax losses, more precisely measures the tax loss, and better predicts reductions in future taxes than existing proxies. We derive a prediction model, which future researchers can employ to better approximate the NOL tax benefits based on readily available financial data. We also demonstrate how NOL nonlinearity affects measurement of corporate tax status. By proposing a new measure and demonstrating trade-offs across competing proxies, we contribute to the work in public economics, corporate finance, and tax accounting that examines the responsiveness of the business sector to corporate tax incentives.","We examine the relation between corporate cash holdings and tax net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). The literature demonstrates that firms should distribute cash to shareholders rather than retain it and generate passive investment income taxed at both corporate and investor levels. However, if the firm’s tax rate on passive income is lower than shareholders’—as when the firm has NOLs—theory also shows that the firm should retain cash and invest on the shareholders’ behalf. Consistent with this, we find that NOLs are associated with higher levels of savings; firms save an additional $0.12 to $0.17 per dollar of tax-effected NOL benefit. Furthermore, investors place a higher value on corporate cash in tax loss firms, consistent with NOLs increasing the after-tax returns on passive investments. The paper adds to the literature studying corporate financial policy responses to taxation and quantifies the role of NOLs in corporate savings decisions.",,
Zhi,Da,University of Notre Dame,Finance,No,,"Using novel data from a crowdsourcing platform for ranking stocks, we investigate how investors form expectations about stock returns over the next week. We find that investors extrapolate from stocks’ recent past returns, with more weight on more recent returns, especially when recent returns are negative, salient, or from a dispersed cross-section. Such extrapolative beliefs are stronger among nonprofessionals and large stocks. Moreover, consensus rankings negatively predict returns over the next week, more so among stocks with low institutional ownership and a high degree of extrapolation. A trading strategy that sorts stocks on investor beliefs generates an economically significant profit.","We track information diffusion in real time by monitoring how the news is tweeted and retweeted on Twitter. We find that news diffusion is highly correlated with intraday trading, especially for retail trading. News diffusion leads to a lower bid-ask spread and price pressure on the news day that is completely reverted the next day. The result is robust when we employ an instrumental variables approach. Our results show that information diffusion via Twitter does not incorporate new information into the stock price. Rather, Twitter spreads stale news, albeit at a much higher speed than traditional media.","When will a large group provide an accurate answer to a question involving quantity estimation? We empirically examine this question on a crowd-based corporate earnings forecast platform (Estimize.com). By tracking user activities, we monitor the amount of public information a user views before making an earnings forecast. We find that the more public information users view, the less weight they put on their own private information. Although this improves the accuracy of individual forecasts, it reduces the accuracy of the group consensus forecast because useful private information is prevented from entering the consensus. To address endogeneity concerns related to a user’s information acquisition choice, we collaborate with Estimize.com to run experiments that restrict the information available to randomly selected stocks and users. The experiments confirm that “independent” forecasts result in a more accurate …",,
Jerry,Hoberg,USC,Finance,No,,"This paper examines startups’ positioning within technological cycles. We use patent text to measure whether innovation pertains to a technological area that is rapidly evolving or stable. We show that innovation in rapidly evolving areas (i.e., early in the cycle) substitute for existing technologies, whereas innovation in stable areas (i.e., later in the cycle) complement them. Our new measure is distinct from existing characterizations of innovation and is economically important. We find that startups in rapidly evolving areas tend to exit via initial public offering, thus remaining independent, consistent with technological substitution. In contrast, startups in stable areas tend to sell out, consistent with technological complementarity and synergies.","We develop a novel 10-K text-based model of product life cycles and examine firm investment policies. Conditioning on the life cycle substantially improves the power of Q to explain investment, and reveals a natural ordering of investments over the life cycle. While R&D and CAPX sensitivity are high early in the cycle, acquisitions arise as firms mature, and divestitures and product extension investments arise as firms decline. Resulting Q sensitivities are remarkably heterogeneous over the cycle, and are even negative in some cases. These life cycle effects are economically larger than those attributable to competition, and are stronger in recent years.","We use computational linguistics to develop a dynamic, interpretable methodology that can detect emerging risks in the financial sector. Our model can predict heightened risk exposures as early as mid-2005, well in advance of the 2008 financial crisis. Risks related to real estate, prepayment, and commercial paper are elevated. Individual bank exposure strongly predicts returns, bank failures, and return volatility. We also document a rise in market instability since 2014 related to sources of funding and mergers and acquisitions. Overall, our model predicts the buildup of emerging risk in the financial system and bank-specific exposures in a timely fashion",,
Lorien,Stice-Lawrence,USC,Accounting,No,textual analysis; alternative data; machine learning,"We use supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (sLDA) to measure differences in the content of the Chinese and English translations of the annual reports of Chinese firms. We find systematic differences in content across languages that are not the mechanical effects of translation and that vary predictably with legal requirements for translation, firm size, and incentives to prioritize different stakeholders. We demonstrate that translation differences exacerbate information asymmetries between Chinese-speaking and English-speaking investors on average, as reflected in lower liquidity in the period after reports are released, especially when the information environment is poor. Firms with larger translation differences are more likely to receive government subsidies and raise larger amounts of equity capital from foreign investors, consistent with translation differences constituting part of firms’ strategy to optimize interactions with stakeholders who speak different languages. Our results highlight the impact of language barriers on cross-country business activities, especially in the context of China, which is growing in prominence as a target for foreign capital","I use internet downloads of regulatory filings by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) employees as a novel measure of ex ante SEC monitoring which includes early stage reviews to explore drivers of the SEC’s attention. In addition to responding to cues from the stock market and business media, SEC employees are subject to a variety of institutional and behavioral frictions. SEC employees engage in less monitoring in times of internal reorganization and are less likely to follow up on leads for firms that are assigned to different regional or industry offices, even when those offices are located within the same building. Further, firms with names falling later in the alphabet are less likely to be monitored, indicating that SEC employees use simple heuristics when prioritizing targets. My evidence suggests such frictions have real effects on firm compliance by failing to head off financial reporting problems before they become more serious.","We use novel satellite data that track the number of cars in the parking lots of 92,668 stores for 71 publicly listed U.S. retailers to study the local information advantage of institutional investors. We establish car counts as a timely measure of store‐level performance and find that institutional investors adjust their holdings in response to the performance of local stores, and that these trades are profitable on average. These results suggest that local investors have an advantage when processing information about nearby operations. However, some institutional investors do not adjust for the quality of their local information and continue to rely on local signals even when they are poor predictors of firm performance and returns. This overreliance on poor local information is reduced for institutional investors with greater industry expertise and those with greater incentives to maximize short‐term trading profits.",,
James,Choi,Yale University,Finance,No,"Household finance, behavioral finance","Many Americans fail to get life-saving vaccines each year, and the availability of a vaccine for COVID-19 makes the challenge of encouraging vaccination more urgent than ever. We present a large field experiment (N = 47,306) testing 19 nudges delivered to patients via text message and designed to boost adoption of the influenza vaccine. Our findings suggest that text messages sent prior to a primary care visit can boost vaccination rates by an average of 5%. Overall, interventions performed better when they were 1) framed as reminders to get flu shots that were already reserved for the patient and 2) congruent with the sort of communications patients expected to receive from their healthcare provider (i.e., not surprising, casual, or interactive). The best-performing intervention in our study reminded patients twice to get their flu shot at their upcoming doctor’s appointment and indicated it was reserved for them. This successful script could be used as a template for campaigns to encourage the adoption of life-saving vaccines, including against COVID-19.","Does automatic enrollment into a retirement plan increase financial distress due to increased borrowing outside the plan? We study a natural experiment created when the U.S. Army began automatically enrolling newly hired civilian employees into the Thrift Savings Plan. Four years after hire, automatic enrollmentincreases cumulative contributions to the plan by 4.1% of annual salary, but we find little evidence ofincreased financial distress. Automatic enrollment causes no significant change in credit scores, debt balances excluding auto debt and first mortgages, or adverse credit outcomes, with the possible exception of increasedfirst‐mortgage balances in foreclosure.","We survey 2484 U.S. individuals with at least $1 million of investable assets about how well leading academic theories describe their financial beliefs and personal investment decisions. The wealthy's beliefs about financial markets and the economy are surprisingly similar to those of the average U.S. household, but the wealthy are less driven by discomfort with the market, financial constraints, and labor income considerations. Portfolio equity share is most affected by professional advice, time until retirement, personal experiences, rare disaster risk, and health risk. Concentrated equity holding is most often motivated by belief that the stock has superior risk-adjusted returns. Beliefs about how expected returns vary with stock characteristics frequently differ from historical relationships, and more risk is not always associated with higher expected returns. Active equity fund investment is most motivated by professional advice and the expectation of higher average returns. Berk and Green (2004) rationalize return chasing in the absence of fund performance persistence by positing that past returns reveal managerial skill but there are diminishing returns to scale in active management. Forty-two percent of respondents agree with the first assumption, 33% with the second, and 19% with both.",,

Fund momentum and fund flow are the most important predictors of future risk-adjusted fund performance, while characteristics of the stocks that funds hold are not predictive. Returns of predictive long-short portfolios are higher following a period of high sentiment or a good state of the macro-economy. Our estimation with neural networks enables us to uncover novel and substantial interaction effects between sentiment and both fund flow and fund momentum.","Using order flow imbalance to estimate price impact, we find that the price elasticity to demand is higher at more aggregate levels. That is, pure idiosyncratic demand (e.g. buying a stock and hedg- ing out all common return components) commands a smaller price elasticity of approximately two, and the parameter increases monotonically to around five for less diversifiable size-book/market style level demand. The results are consistent with liquidity providers being more reluctant to trade against price dislocations at more aggregate levels, possibly due to risk aversion or portfolio constraints, and inconsistent with information-based mechanisms of price impact. Together with the fact that there are large order flow imbalances at more aggregate levels, our results suggest that investor demand could be more important for driving price fluctuations at more aggregate levels.",,,
Travis,Dyer,Brigham Young University,Accounting,No,"Disclosure, information acquisition, quantitative investing, mutual funds, identity, behavioral biases, comovement.","We examine the effect of news media consolidation on local business news dissemination and its consequences for local investors and capital markets. We use acquisitions of television stations by Sinclair Inc. as plausibly exogenous shocks to local news coverage since Sinclair is alleged to reduce local news budgets and homogenize news coverage. Using large-scale television transcripts data, we find that coverage of local firms drops substantially following Sinclair acquisitions. Further, we document that investor attention, trading, portfolio holdings, and stock return synchronicity all become less locally concentrated for firms in treated geographic areas, and that the informational advantage of local analysts decreases and bid-ask spreads increase. The results are pronounced for small firms, for stations with higher ex-ante viewership, and for stations with greater decreases in local coverage. In combination, these results provide insight into the consequences of media consolidation for local business coverage, investors, and capital markets.","Existing research often assumes that firms’ financial reporting choices influence their return comovement with other firms. We examine the validity of that assumption. First, we provide initial evidence suggesting that similarity in two firms’ disclosures not only predicts, but influences, future return comovement between those two firms. Second, we show that this predictive ability aggregates to the market level; disclosure similarity can be used to estimate more accurate forward-looking market betas. Taken together, these two results imply that managers can influence their firms’ betas by altering their firms’ disclosures–a prominent assumption in existing research, but one with little empirical support until now.","I examine the demand for public information by local and nonlocal investors. Using novel data on institutional investors' requests for financial information from the SEC, I document that investors acquire approximately 20% more financial information for their local investments. This pattern holds after controlling for investors’ 13(f) portfolio holdings. I further demonstrate that this pattern is concentrated in stocks eliciting behavioral biases as well as among investors with strong company relationships. Consistent with public information acquisition being more beneficial to local investors, I find that local investors exhibit both enhanced timeliness in acquiring public information and superior portfolio trading decisions when acquiring public information (on the order of 0.5% per quarter). In sum, these results provide evidence that investors demand more, and benefit more from, public information on local investments.",,
Jonas,Heese,Harvard University,Accounting,No,(social) media monitoring; corporate misconduct,"We examine whether the local press is an effective monitor of corporate misconduct. Specifically, we study the effects of local newspaper closures on violations by local facilities of publicly listed firms. After a local newspaper closure, local facilities increase violations by 1.1% and penalties by 15.2%, indicating that the closures reduce firm monitoring by the press. This effect is not driven by the underlying economic conditions, the underlying local fraud environment, or the underlying firm conditions. Taken together, our findings indicate that local newspapers are an important monitor of firms’ misconduct.","I study whether industry employment of active regulators weakens oversight. To examine this question, I exploit that the Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel (FREP), the German capital-market regulator responsible for enforcing public firms’ compliance with accounting standards, allows its senior regulators to serve on boards of public firms during their FREP tenure. I find that firms are less likely to face enforcement actions after they appoint active regulators to their board. After such an appointment, firms are more likely to receive a qualified audit opinion, more likely to have an above-normal risk of accounting manipulation, as measured by an F-score greater than one, and exhibit higher income-increasing abnormal accruals. These findings suggest that directorships of active regulators can result in conflicts of interest that weaken oversight.","We examine drivers and consequences of U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) oversight of whistleblower cases of corporate fraud against the government. We find that the DOJ is more likely to intervene in and conduct longer investigations of cases that have a higher chance of victory and yield greater monetary proceeds, indicating that DOJ enforcement is influenced by its performance measures. DOJ intervention also affects the firm- and aggregate-level fraud environment. Firms subject to DOJ intervention improve their employee relations, internal controls, and board independence, and experience lower future whistleblowing risk. Whistleblowers avoid courts and agencies with low DOJ intervention rates. In contrast, we do not find that cases pursued by whistleblowers alone affect firms' or whistleblowers' behavior, suggesting that public enforcement through DOJ intervention has a greater deterrent effect on fraud than private enforcement by whistleblowers acting alone.",,
Henry,Friedman,UCLA,Accounting,No,"Financial reporting, retail investors, real effects, machine learning","This paper develops a multi-firm equilibrium model of information acquisition based on differences in firms’ characteristics. It is shown that higher market-level uncertainty attracts investor attention to firm-level earnings announcements. Increased investor attention magnifies the earnings response coefficients of all announcing firms. However, reactions to increased attention differ by firm characteristics (eg, firms with higher systematic risk attract more investor attention and their prices react more to earnings announcements). In the model, heightened investor attention caused by high uncertainty implies a steeper CAPM relation. The implications of the model for the cross section of firms are tested using firm-level attention measures and stock returns around earnings announcements and using CAPM portfolio tests on high-versus low-uncertainty days","We provide a theoretical framework for reporting of firms' environmental and social impact (ESI). In our model the characteristics of a ESI report impact managerial efforts related to ESI, cash flows, stock prices, and greenwashing. In particular, we describe the implications of ESI report congruity, whether the report captures ESI inputs or outcomes, and the manager's tradeoffs regarding ESI efforts and reporting bias. Although stock price incentives tend to encourage ESI efforts and greenwashing simultaneously, ESI reports that capture ESI effects on cash flows tend to have a stronger price reactions than ESI reports that capture effects on ESI per se. ESI reports aligned with investors' aggregate preferences provide stronger incentives and lead to more positive outcomes than ESI reports that focus on either ESI or cash flow effects individually.","This paper uses holdings and outage data from Robinhood to examine how retail investors affect the pricing of public earnings information. We find that retail trader activity is associated with prices that are more responsive to earnings surprises, and earnings announcements affected by seemingly random retail trading outages experience weaker price responses. These results are concentrated in firms that are smaller and have less robust informational environments. Additionally, retail activity is associated with more timely price responses to earnings over multiple days but slower price discovery in 5-minute intervals, suggesting that the role of retail trade may differ depending on the time horizon considered. Overall, our results suggest that retail investors can improve price efficiency and do not support the characterization of retail investors as pure sources of noise in returns.",,
Ekaterina,Neretina,USC,Finance,No,"Textual analysis, machine learning","I show that lobbying generates negative externalities, which affect non-lobbying companies. When a piece of new legislation passes in Congress, non-lobbying companies in aggregate lose $1.9bn in market value. I obtain this result using a novel dataset combining comprehensive information on corporate lobbying activity with congressional activity on bills. To explain why negatively affected companies do not lobby, I identify two frictions that hinder them. First, non-lobbying companies do not represent enough voting power to support politicians in the elections. Second, trade associations, which could represent their collective interests, are captured by companies that lobby individually. I demonstrate this mechanism using unique hand-collected data on membership in the main trade associations. These findings have important policy implications: they highlight the economic mechanisms which could be targeted by policies regulating corporate lobbying.","Using a novel empirical approach, based on a new measure of bargaining power, we show that powerful underwriters drive corporate bond contracts in their favor. Our measure of underwriter power is based on the comparative ability of banks to place bonds. The key feature of our approach is that bargaining power varies for a given underwriter facing different bond issuers at a given point in time, allowing us to separate the effects of bargaining power from those of reputation and certification with a fixed effects strategy. We find that bargaining power increases both underwriter fees and bond offering yields, to an increased combined cost of USD 1.5 million, or 7% of the average costs for the issuer. We rule out a number of alternative mechanisms, notably issuer-underwriter “loyalty”. Our findings are in line with the predictions of the market dominance and agency theories.","We study the performance of dominant law firms (""stars"") in litigation brought against publicly traded corporations. We use insurance coverage as a benchmark for expected settlement amounts, to separate to what extent (a) stars reach more favorable settlements on any lawsuit (a performance or treatment effect) or (b) stars are retained in lawsuits where a favorable settlement is ex ante more likely (a selection effect). Our findings indicate the latter, and that star firms have an economically small impact on settlement amounts. This result is not explained by measurement error or over-/under-insurance. The extent to which stars are associated with improvements in corporate governance also appears limited. The stars' large market share and the high fees they earn may be justified by their ability to reduce uncertainty about the lawsuit outcome or by frictions, such as aggressive marketing and limited client sophistication and bargaining power, which limits the stars’ clients’ ability to turn to other law firms.",,

interaction between information processing costs and firms actions","We use trade-level data to examine the role of actively managed funds (AMFs) in earnings news dissemination. We find that AMFs are drawn to, and participate disproportionately more in, earnings announcements (EAs) that include bundled managerial guidance. When the two pieces of news are directionally inconsistent, AMFs trade in the direction of future guidance rather than current earnings. AMFs exhibit an ability to discern, and adapt their trading to, the bias in bundled guidance. While AMF trades at EAs are generally more profitable than their non-EA trades, this result reverses when guidance bias is extreme. Overall, we find that increased AMF trading during EAs leads to faster price adjustment. Collectively, these findings suggest that AMFs are sophisticated processors of bundled earnings news, and their trading generally improves market price discovery.","This study tests whether disclosing a trader's identity dampens or stimulates subsequent trading volume based on the trader's reputation for being informed. While a reputation for being informed makes markets less liquid, thus inhibiting subsequent trade ("" illiquidity effect""), the information others glean from informed trade might motivate subsequent trade ("" information effect""). To study which of these countervailing forces dominates, we use a setting where mandated short-position disclosures in Europe reveal the trader's identity at the time of trade. Changes in bid-ask spreads are positively associated with several proxies for the short seller's reputation: the short seller is local, has higher returns from previous short sales, and is a hedge fund or investment adviser. Despite the positive association between reputation and illiquidity, we show that reputation motivates more subsequent trade. We also provide evidence that future price informativeness increases with trader reputation. Thus, our results support the notion that the"" information effect"" dominates the"" illiquidity effect."" Our study contributes to the literature by investigating the interaction among investor identification, adverse selection, and trade.","We show that financial reporting spurs consumer behavior. Using granular GPS data, we show that foot-traffic to firms’ commerce locations significantly increases in the days following their earnings announcements. Foot-traffic increases more for announcements with extreme earnings surprises, that correspond to firms’ fiscal year-ends, that occur outside of Fridays, and that elicit greater internet search volume, consistent with earnings announcements spurring consumer behavior by garnering attention. Consumer activity also rises with reductions in solvency risk among firms selling durable goods, consistent with consumers responding to information about firms’ longevity conveyed by their earnings. Using demographic information, we show financial reporting disproportionately affects foot-traffic in populations more likely to consume financial news. Collectively, these results suggest earnings announcements serve a marketing function by drawing attention to firms, and that a byproduct of the financial reporting process is that it shapes consumer behavior.",,
Douglas,Skinner,University of Chicago Booth School of Business,Accounting,No,"Financial Reporting, Disclosure, Technology, Sports","We describe the process through which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) makes filings “publicly available.” For a sample of Form 4 (insider trade) filings, we show that, during the period we examine, the majority of filings are available to paying subscribers of the SEC's public dissemination system (PDS) feed before they are posted to the EDGAR website, and so provide subscribers and their clients with a private advantage. We show that this advantage translates into an economically significant trading advantage, and prices, volumes, and spreads respond to the news contained in filings beginning around 30 seconds before public posting. These findings indicate that the SEC dissemination process does not always provide a level playing field and that the meaning of publicly available information in capital markets is no longer simple or obvious. In response to our study, the SEC launched an investigation and agreed to eliminate the PDS timing advantage.","Shareholder activism is now an important global phenomenon. We use a sample of nearly 7,000 activist shareholder campaigns across 56 countries to address two principal research questions related to the rise of activism. First, we develop a measure of corporate governance regulation that captures the extent to which a country’s laws facilitate minority-shareholder engagement, a necessary condition for successful intervention, and show that our measure explains cross-country variation in the emergence of activism. Second, we exploit changes in these regulations to examine how an increase in the threat of activism affects corporate outcomes, both for targeted firms and for firms not explicitly targeted by activists. Our evidence suggests that regulatory changes that facilitate investor activism result in increased profitability, higher payouts, and reduced investments. These effects are concentrated in countries where the preexisting governance regulations are weaker and the pre-law-change level of activism was relatively low.","We provide new evidence on the role of management guidance in explaining earnings announcement-period returns. We show that guidance practices changed around the financial crisis in ways likely to affect the information content of guidance bundled with earnings. Managers provide guidance for a number of metrics and have moved towards annual and away from quarterly guidance, perhaps because of concerns about the managerial “myopia” some associate with quarterly EPS guidance. EPS and/or sales guidance news is incrementally informative and explains returns to about the same extent as earnings news, more so when earnings disappoint or firms report large beats. Specifications that capture the sign and consistency of signals are about as informative as those that use magnitudes. Similar to previous evidence, the response is asymmetric, with a stronger response to adverse earnings news accompanied by downgrades.",,

Users of an online account aggregation app received a personalized index representing their net worth as a lifetime monthly cash flow. The presentation of the index varied in the framing used to describe the index and in the salience of the comparison between the index and the user's historical spending. Consumers that received a consumption frame (promoting a mental reflection about the affordability of future consumption) and a salient comparison with historical spending decreased their discretionary spending by 15% relative to other treatments throughout the eight months of the experiment. The effect persisted for an additional eight months after the removal of the experiment content from the app. The sensitivity of consumers' spending to information design presents opportunities for policies aimed at influencing saving rates.","In a randomized field experiment, I show that information architecture significantly affects individuals' spending and savings behavior. I present users of a large online account aggregation provider with a personalized financial index. This index represents the inflation-protected, lifetime monthly cash flow that they can obtain, given their personal financial and demographic information and current market prices. Users receiving this information tool reduce their spending by 10.7% relative to a control group. This effect is sensitive to the description of the index using a consumption frame rather than an investment frame and to the presentation of an explicit comparison between the index and historical spending levels. Further, spending reductions are primarily in large, infrequent transactions. This experiment is the first to directly affect overall spending behavior and to demonstrate the importance of information architecture in that context. It demonstrates the potential of low cost digital information tools to impact financial behavior on a large scale.","Using high-frequency spending data, we show that household consumption displays excess sensitivity to salient macro-economic news, even when the news is not real. When the announced local unemployment rate reaches a 12-month maximum, local news coverage of unemployment increases and local consumers reduce their discretionary spending by 2% relative to consumers in areas with the same macro-economic fundamentals. The consumption of low-income households displays greater excess sensitivity to salience. The decrease in spending is not reversed in subsequent months; instead, negative news persistently reduces future spending for two to four months. Households in treated areas act as if they are more financially constrained than those in untreated areas with the same fundamentals.",,
Matteo,Benetton,Berkeley Haas,Finance,No,"IO, Finance, Crypto, ETF","Cryptomining, the clearing of cryptocurrency transactions, uses large quantities of electricity. We document that cryptominers' use of local electricity implies higher prices for existing small businesses and households. Studying the electricity market in Upstate NY and using the Bitcoin price as an exogenous shifter of the supply curve faced by the community, we estimate that small businesses and households have a negative elasticity to the instrumented price of electricity, with elasticities of-0.17 and-0.07 respectively. Using our estimations, we calculate counterfactual electricity bills, finding that small businesses and households paid $79 million and $165 million extra annually in Upstate NY (or $1 B nationally) because of cryptomining demand-for-electricity effects. Using data on China, where prices are fixed, we find that rationing of electricity in cities with cryptomining entrants deteriorate wages and investments, consistent with an electricity crowding out of the local economy. Local governments in both Upstate NY and China, however, realize more business taxes, but only offsetting a small portion of the higher community electricity bill costs. Our results point to a yet-unstudied negative spillover from technology processing to local communities, which would need to be considered against welfare benefits.","We explore the impact of investors’ beliefs on cryptocurrency demand and prices using three new individual-level surveys. We find that younger individuals with lower income and education are more optimistic about the future value of cryptocurrencies, as are late investors. We then estimate the cryptocurrency demand functions using a structural model with rich heterogeneity in investors’ beliefs and preferences. To identify the model, we combine observable beliefs with an instrumental variable strategy that exploits variation in the amount of energy required for the production of the different cryptocurrencies. We find that beliefs explain a large fraction of the cross-sectional variance of returns. A counterfactual exercise shows that banning entry of late investors leads to a decrease in the price of Bitcoin by about $3,500, or approximately 30% of the price during the boom in January 2018. Late investors’ optimism alone can explain about a third of the decline.","Cryptomining gives rise to negative externalities through consumption of scarce electricity. Thus why do local governments pursue cryptominers and what are the broader effects of cryptomining on the local economy? Our testimonial evidence supports cryptomining as a source of tax revenues and purported local economy spillovers. Using a novel panel dataset for counties in China and New York State, we take these claims to the data. In Chinese cities, we find that cryptomining substantially increases business tax revenues relative to GDP, thus providing a strong incentive for local governments to attract this type of operations. However, we also find a negative impact on local wages and value added taxes (as a fraction of GDP). In New York State, we find that cryptomining results in substantially higher electricity prices for businesses and commercial operations. These findings suggest that cryptomining leads to crowdingout of other economic activities and point to possibly unintended consequences that local governments should factor in their decisions.",,

We find that historical cost accounting (HCA) in capital regulation significantly mutes the impact of QE on bank lending and creates bank-level heterogeneity in the transmission of QE. This heterogeneity in turn allows some banks to increase lending at the expense of their competitors, reducing the impact of QE on overall bank lending. These results suggest that while HCA can insulate banks’ balance sheets during periods of distress, it also limits the effectiveness of central bank policies aimed at increasing lending.","This paper investigates the importance of status in household consumption and credit decisions using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances linked to tract-level data in the American Community Survey. We find that relatively richer households in the census tract use more debt and spend more on high-status cars. Also, county-level evidence shows that the consumption of high-status cars is higher in more unequal counties. These results suggest that greater income heterogeneity might shape household consumption and credit decisions, as relatively richer households signal their higher status to their neighbors through the consumption of visible status goods.","This paper finds that banks and nonbanks respond differently to increased competition in consumer credit markets. Increased competition and a greater threat of failure induces banks to specialize in relationship business lending, and surviving banks are more profitable. However, nonbanks change their credit policy when faced with more competition and expand credit to riskier borrowers at the extensive margin, resulting in higher default rates. These results show how the effects of competition depend on the form of intermediation. They also suggest that increased competition can cause credit risk to migrate outside the traditional supervisory umbrella.",,

To provide insights into the economics of staking and its asset pricing implications, we build a continuous-time model of a token-based economy agents heterogeneous in wealth stake tokens to earn rewards or use tokens for transactional convenience, all while dynamically solving their wealth allocation and consumption problem. We cast the model as a mean field game with individual stochastic controls and highlight aggregate staking ratio as a key variable linking staking to token pricing and equilibrium reward rate. The model uses transaction convenience to rationalize violations of the uncovered interest rate parity and significant carry premia in the data (eg, a long-short carry yields a Sharpe ratio of 1.6). We relate cryptocurrencies to other major asset classes such as currencies and commodities and empirically corroborate model implications. In particular, staking ratios capture liquidity and market depth, and its correlation with reward rates is positive in the cross section but negative in the time series. Higher reward rates attract greater future staking, increasing individual's staking allocation and the staking ratio in aggregate, which in turn predicts positive excess returns.","Despite the explosive growth of cryptocurrencies, whether the underlying technology adds significant value and will thus sustain broad adoption remains unclear. Using proprietary data on firm-level blockchain records from 2015 to 2021, we conduct the first large-sample study linking blockchains to firm fundamentals and asset valuation in a country where cryptocurrencies are completely banned. We find that year-over-year quarterly blockchain data growth (BDG) contains value-relevant information for nowcasting and forecasting assets growth, sales growth, ROA, standardized unexpected earnings (SUE), and innovation outcomes measured through patents. BDG also predicts stock returns, especially around future earnings announcements, with a long-short BDG-sorted portfolio generating a 10.56% risk-adjusted return annually. The findings are robust across industries and regions, superior compared to other nowcasters, and hold in international samples. We further discuss the underlying economic channels (eg, continuous disclosure and reduction in information asymmetry) and propose strategies for identifying the blockchain impact. We find results consistent with the aforementioned channels, actual use cases, and heterogeneity analyses that reveal firms with greater information asymmetry, lower disclosure quality, more industry competition, and less public trust benefit more from blockchain adoption and on-chain data growth.","We document characteristics-based return anomalies in a large cross-section of crypto assets. Cryptocurrency returns exhibit momentum in the largest-cap group, reversals in other size groups, and strong crypto value and network adoption premia, from which we derive two novel factors to add to the cryptocurrency version of market, size, and momentum factors. The resulting C-5 model outperforms extant models in pricing the cross-section of crypto assets. We also provide the first comprehensive classification of all major cryptocurrencies based on their economic functionality. We then adopt methodologies from international finance to demonstrate significant market segmentation across token categories, underscoring the importance for considering token categories in investment and regulatory policymaking.",,

The common interpretation for this result-that momentum resides in firm-specific returns-is unwarranted: even in the absence of firm-specific momentum, a strategy sorted on residuals is profitable because it is also a bet against betas. A UMD-like factor that removes these bets to capture true firm-specific momentum earns an alpha of 63 basis points per month (t-value= 9.20). Firm-specific momentum strategies, unlike residual momentum strategies, are almost uncorrelated across regions. Our results indicate that there was a strong firm-specific momentum effect in stock returns until 2002, after which it has been almost fully arbitraged away.","Long-term expected returns do not appear to vary in the cross section of stocks. We show that even negligible persistent differences in expected returns, if they existed, would be easy to detect. Markers of such differences, however, are absent from actual stock returns. Our results are consistent with behavioral models and production-based asset pricing models in which firms’ risks change over time. Consistent with the lack of long-term differences in expected returns, persistent differences in firm characteristics do not predict the cross section of stock returns.

The authors show, across a wide variety of factors and geographical markets, that factors constructed from fundamental characteristics have earned high returns, whereas those constructed from statistical betas have earned returns close to zero. When designing factor-based investment strategies, investors should seek exposure to the fundamental characteristics that define a factor and use statistical measures of factor betas to manage factor risks. Conversely, seeking to gain exposure to factor betas is a misguided means of obtaining the returns available from factor investing.",,

Zahn,Bozanic,Florida State University,Accounting,No,"Corporate disclosure, debt contracting, information intermediaries, regulation","Critics have alleged that securitization accounting prior to 2010 was among the causes of the recent financial crisis. In response to this criticism, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) implemented two new accounting standards, SFAS 166 and SFAS 167, to improve the financial reporting for securitizations. Bank regulators have stated their belief that SFAS 166/167 will result in a consolidated balance sheet (and risk-based capital ratios based thereupon) that better reflects a bank's exposure to risk related to securitized assets. We document that, by ceding retained power or influence through the servicing/special servicing functions to third parties, SFAS 166/167 resulted in real effects to the extent that banks (particularly those that were weakly capitalized) achieved their accounting objectives in the post-SFAS 166/167 period through legitimate transaction structuring in line with the intent of the new rules. Further, we use capital market participants’ assessments of risk retention by sponsoring banks as a benchmark, and provide evidence consistent with bank regulators’ beliefs. In particular, following SFAS 166/167, equity investors of sponsoring banks do not consider (consider) as risk relevant securitized assets that receive off-balance sheet (on-balance sheet) treatment. Securitized assets that are consolidated under SFAS 166/167 exhibit the same risk relevance as assets that are not securitized, despite contractual provisions that would seem to imply substantial risk transfer.","Drawing on financial reporting, institutional, and social psychology theories, we consider whether awareness of SEC scrutiny affects the extent to which managers exercise financial reporting discretion. Because there is a higher probability that the SEC will detect misconduct and impose penalties on firms under investigation, we predict that managers will change their behavior during periods of increased scrutiny. We test our predictions using novel data on all Division of Enforcement (DoE) investigations completed during the 2000-2016 period. The evidence we present offers three insights. First, our results suggest that managers perceive the SEC will be more concerned, and potentially more punitive, with firms that employ discretion through accruals rather than real activities. Second, the actions taken by managers appear to reflect improvements in accounting misstatement risk, reductions in accounting irregularities, and increases in conservatism. Third, firms investigated by the SEC, but not ultimately subject to an enforcement action, exhibit decreased R&D and capital expenditures and increased likelihoods of CEO turnover, comment letter receipt, earnings restatements, and class-action lawsuits. The implications of our study should be of interest to academics, investors, and regulators in understanding how heightened regulatory monitoring over financial reporting can affect both accounting practices and operating decisions.","Financial reporting fraud and other forms of financial reporting misconduct are a significant threat to the existence and efficiency of capital markets.

Using a large sample of US public companies spanning the period 2000-2019, we find that firm-specific media coverage is negatively associated with leverage. Our results suggest the media caters relatively more to equity investors, who largely rely on public information, than to debt investors, who are often privy to privileged information. We arrive at similar conclusions when we exploit plausibly exogenous changes in investor base and investor access to privileged information. Among debt investors, the media appears to cater to public bond holders more than private banks. Among equity investors, the media appears to cater to quasi-index institutions. Additionally, cross-sectional variation in media coverage based on investment and article types reveals that the media’s role is far more nuanced than previously documented. Overall, our findings suggest that financial media coverage is significantly influenced by less sophisticated professional investors’ demand for information to help monitor firms.","CEOs of S&P 500 firms that report high non-GAAP earnings relative to GAAP earnings receive substantial unexplained pay. Crucially, this result remains even after controlling for the level of non-GAAP and GAAP earnings. These firms are relatively poor performers (ie, low GAAP earnings and stock returns) and have less powerful CEOs, consistent with non-GAAP earnings being used as justification when high executive pay is more likely to cause outrage. Additionally, despite the lower GAAP and return performance, these firms are more likely to beat the earnings targets specified in their compensation plans, which likely increases investors’ perceptions of core operating earnings and reduces outrage. Indeed, these firms face less dissent from shareholders and proxy advisors, and no additional media scrutiny. Our evidence suggests that the fraction of CEO pay that seems attributable to opportunistic non-GAAP reporting, while limited, is economically meaningful.","This paper examines how the media responds to deterioration in a firm’s information environment. We exploit brokerage mergers and closures as a negative shock that affected not only analyst coverage, but also market prices and liquidity as well as firms’ real and disclosure decisions. We find an increase in media coverage of affected firms’ earnings announcements (EA). This is the case for both in-depth articles and headline alerts. However, the increase in EA coverage is more than offset by a decrease during other periods, which is likely the result of increased costs of covering non-EA news. When we examine the editorial content of the coverage, we find that EA articles become more negative and more informative, as measured by the ability of media sentiment to predict future performance. Crucially, the changes we document in both the quantity and content of media coverage are concentrated among firms that already had relatively poor information environments. Overall, our paper provides nuanced evidence on the media’s dependence on the proper functioning of other aspects of a firm’s information environment.",,

We compare treated (control) college students enrolled in the same course contemporaneously at the same university, whose families reside in areas that experience (do not experience) climate events. Families in affected areas are more likely to become financially constrained. Afterward, treated students exhibit poorer academic performance, are less likely to enroll in STEM courses, are more likely to quit courses or drop out, and are more likely to default on student loans later in life. The effects are mostly driven by disruption to family financial resources rather than psychological stress. The effects are stronger for middle class students relying on family income to pay for college; poor students are immune from the financial disruption because they already rely heavily on external financing; high-income family students can navigate disasters with little impact because contributions to college attendance stem from wealth rather than income. Additionally, male and non-white students are more negatively affected by financial disruption. Our results suggest implications for families disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and, more broadly, suggest consequences for climate change to the extent it exacerbates weather volatility.","This paper shows that perseverant behavior during college predicts default risk later in life.

Utilizing post-college financial distress, second differences, and proof by contradiction, we show that factors potentially confounding the observed behavior, such as students’ private information about human capital value, are unlikely to explain our results.",,
Shijia,Wu,The Chinese Univeristy of Hong Kong - Shenzhen,Accounting,No,,"We propose the visual attention hypothesis that visuals in firm earnings announcements increase attention to the earnings news.

Consistent with managerial opportunism, firms are more likely to use visuals in their earnings tweets when performance is good but less persistent. Consistent with visuals increasin g investor attention, the initial return response to earnings news is stronger and the post-announcement response is lower when visuals are used. Our evidence of a post-announcement return reversal indicates that visuals can be a double-edged sword. Furthermore, the higher earnings response coefficient from visuals is more pronounced on days with high investor distraction (when many other firms are also announcing earnings).","Using comment streams on Seeking Alpha articles, we examine whether interacting on social media increases or moderates the extremeness of investors’ opinions. We exploit machine learning based text analysis algorithms to classify not just the direction of opinion expressed in a given comment, but how extreme it is. Unlike findings from political science, which show online interaction increasing extremeness, we find that in the context of analyzing companies and stocks, online interaction moderates extremeness. Both in terms of directional extremeness, and extremeness of language used, comments become less extreme over the sequence of comments for a given article, within individual comment sub-threads, and over a single user’s comments for a given article. Extremeness moderation occurs both following earnings announcements and during non-earnings-announcement windows. Additional analyses provide insights as to what factors might drive extremeness-moderation. Extremeness reduction is strongest when users are selfidentified (ie, not anonymous), and when the article users are commenting on is more moderate. Finally, results suggest that the extremeness reduction triggered by Seeking Alpha articles has market implications. Market-based differences of opinion measures decrease significantly after Seeking Alpha articles, but not after matched non-article days, analyst forecast days, or news article days.

Ryan,Guggenmos,Cornell University,Accounting,No,"Social Media, Fintech Intermediaries","Archival accounting research documents a robust association between misreporting and suboptimal firm performance, and proposes economics-based explanations. Our study provides an additional behavioral explanation. Drawing on psychology research, we predict that misreporting leads to worse cognitive performance than truthful reporting, which could impact the quality of firms’ operating decisions. And further, that the effect will be stronger when individuals anticipate future scrutiny of their misreporting. Using a controlled experiment, we find that misreporting in one task leads to worse performance in an unrelated cognitive task. Contrary to our prediction, we find that this effect holds whether misreporters anticipate imminent scrutiny of their reporting, or whether they have already misreported and no longer anticipate imminent scrutiny. Our findings suggest that misreporting increases cognitive load by taxing cognitive capacity both in anticipation and following scrutiny. Our study complements prior archival research on misreporting by providing additional evidence as to why and how misreporting might be associated with suboptimal firm performance.","We examine how information dissemination via mobile device applications (apps) affects nonprofessional investors' judgments. In response to the prevalence of mobile device use, the media ungroups content into smaller pieces to accommodate users, and apps use push notifications to highlight this content. These changes increase users' ability to access investment information in real time, leaving some investors feeling as if they are missing out if they are not continuously connected. We validate a scale to capture investors' fear of missing out on investment information (I-FoMO) and document that I-FoMO is distinct from traditional FoMO that occurs in social settings. Then, using an experiment, we find that receiving ungrouped content via a mobile device has a greater effect on investment allocations in the presence, rather than absence, of push notifications. Further, we find that these results hold for higher, but not for lower, I-FoMO investors.","This paper discusses the role of process evidence in accounting research.

To incorporate non-linear relations, we employ a recently developed multivariate matching approach (entropy balancing) to adjust for determinants in place of relying on a linear model. Entropy balancing identifies weights for the control sample to equalize the distribution of determinants across treatment and control samples. In simulations drawing random samples from deciles where a linear model displays poor fit, we find that entropy balancing significantly improves accrual model specification by reducing coefficient bias relative to linear and propensity-score matched models. Consistent with entropy balancing retaining sufficient power, we find that its estimates detect seeded accrual manipulations and explain variation in accruals around equity issuances.",,

Consistent with visuals increasin g investor attention, the initial return response to earnings news is stronger and the post-announcement response is lower when visuals are used. Our evidence of a post-announcement return reversal indicates that visuals can be a double-edged sword. Furthermore, the higher earnings response coefficient from visuals is more pronounced on days with high investor distraction (when many other firms are also announcing earnings).","Firms often register trademarks as they launch new products or services. We find that the number of new trademark registrations positively predicts firm profitability, stock returns, and underreaction by analysts in their earnings forecasts. Using the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (FTDA) as an exogenous shock to trademark protection, we find that greater trademark protection strengthens the predictability of new trademark registrations. Together, our evidence suggests that investors undervalue new trademark registrations.","We test how market overvaluation affects corporate innovation. Estimated stock overvaluation is strongly associated with measures of innovative inventiveness (novelty, originality, and scope), as well as research and development (R&D) and innovative output (patent and citation counts). Misvaluation affects R&D more via a nonequity channel than via equity issuance. The sensitivity of innovative inventiveness to misvaluation increases with share turnover and overvaluation. The frequency of exceptionally high innovative inputs/outputs increases with overvaluation. This evidence suggests that market overvaluation may generate social value by increasing innovative output and encouraging firms to engage in “moon shots.”",,

Zhao,Zhang,USC,Finance,Yes,,"The popularity of smart devices and the increase of access rate are switching Internet from link-centric (host-to-host) to content-centric (user-to-content). Since the primary purpose of users is to find their desired contents from the Internet, the traditional host-to-host structure will cause lots of useless traffic and decrease the network efficiency. Content-centric network (CCN) is then introduced to solve this embarrassed situation. As a new-born technology, CCN has not fully explored its potential to utilize the knowledge embedded in the contents. Hence, we propose to enhance the information extraction capability of CCN with data driving methods. Specifically, we add a label vector containing feature descriptions for each content, and then apply neural network (NN) to model users' behavior and predict their responses to new contents. To further increase prediction accuracy and potential benefits, we group users into different cells. The behavior sets of users in a cell at different time intervals are modeled by a series of NNs. Moreover, we design a new caching policy to improve network caching efficiency. Benefits in other aspects and future research directions are also discussed. Quantitative evaluations of the proposed model and caching policy are presented in the end of this paper.","The cognitive radio technology allows secondary user (SU) to share the licensed spectrum by adapting its transmission power in a sensing-based spectrum sharing manner. Reliable spectrum prediction and channel selection could alleviate the processing delays and enhance the spectrum utilization. In this paper, we propose a new strategy for spectrum prediction and channel selection using online machine learning techniques, which consists of three stages: 1) SU utilizes online learning techniques for the regression of received transmit power on different licenced frequency bands; 2) SU predicts the probability of each primary user's status (busy/idle) based on the power regression results; 3) SU optimizes channel selection in terms of expected ergodic capacities from the prediction outcomes. The proposed strategy can not only save time and energy, but also enhance the throughput of SU. The performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated through extensive simulations.",,,
TJ,Wong,USC,Accounting,No,Textual analysis; social media; field experiments ,"When emerging market firms disclose relationship-based transactions, they face a trade-off in which greater transparency may help lower their cost of capital at the cost of revealing proprietary information. We find that firms overcome this challenge by relying on analysts within their private networks (i.e., connected analysts) who, through repeated interaction with the firm, can better verify relationship-based transactions. Using Chinese firms, we show that firms with more connected analysts have more accurate consensus forecasts and lower forecast dispersion. When a connected analyst departs and stops covering a firm, the accuracy and informativeness of the unconnected analysts' forecasts decrease, suggesting that information spills over from the connected analyst to analysts outside the network. We find a potential mechanism for this information spillover: communication through common institutional clients, which suggests that embedded financial analysts—those sharing close connections with firms and analysts—serve as a channel for disseminating proprietary, hard-to-verify information.","This paper examines whether social media delineate the bias of state-controlled traditional media by supplying less optimistically biased information to the market. Using a comprehensive sample of corporate news articles of Chinese newspapers and posts of an online stock forum, East Guba, from 2009 to 2016, we find that East Guba’s tone is less positively associated with that of the newspapers for the same firm on the same day when the newspapers are expected to be more optimistically biased. This decline in association in tone is significantly larger since the 2015 political shock which suppressed the reporting of negative corporate news by traditional media. Finally, when the tone of the newspapers deviates positively from that of East Guba, the newspaper articles are perceived by the market to be less credible as reflected in their significantly attenuated stock return response.","This paper examines whether, in an autocratic regime such as China, social media that rely on the wisdom of crowds correct the bias of state-controlled traditional media by supplying less optimistically biased information to the market. Using a comprehensive sample of Chinese newsppaper corporate news articles and posts of an online stock forum, East Guba, from 2009 to 2016, we find that the positive association of the tone of newspapers and East Guba of the same firm on the same day is significantly reduced when newspapers are expected to exhibit more optimistic bias, consistent with our conjecture that social media plays a role in correcting the bias of traditional media. Further analyses show that political factors such as state ownership of the firms being covered and the political sensitivity of the periods during which the articles are posted shape East Guba’s monitoring role in correcting the newspapers’ bias. Finally, the stock return results also support the conjecture that social media supplies information that serves as a benchmark to delineate the bias of traditional media. When the tone of traditional media deviates positively from that of social media, the stock return response to traditional media’s articles is significantly attenuated, but we do not find any significant change in stock return response to social media’s posts when their tone deviates from that of traditional media.",,
Chris,Jones,USC,Finance,No,,"We introduce a generalized statistical learning method, sparse orthogonal factor regression (SOFAR), in testing linear factor models with both large numbers of factors and testing assets. Our approach encompasses most of the existing methods in the literature and can be used in many other scenarios with large data sets. Applying SOFAR, we can select the latent factors from the whole swath of 219 candidate factors proposed by the literature simultaneously, identify test assets associated with the selected latent factors, and interpret them. We can also select the latent factors and correlated characteristics in the IPCA framework without bootstrapping. Without firm characteristics instrumenting, we find that four latent factors (market, investment, intangible, and frictions) are relevant to the covariance of asset returns and three types of factors (profitability, asset liquidity, and liquidity bets) price assets in cross-section. We also find that the out-of-sample prediction for the asset pricing model can be more precise with candidate factor selections. With characteristics as instruments, we only identify one factor, and the correlated characteristics are beta, size, momentum, and liquidity.","We analyze the out-of-sample performance of variables shown to forecast future mutual fund alphas. The degree of predictability, as measured by alpha spreads from quintile sorts or cross-sectional regression slopes, falls by at least half post-sample. These declines appear to be primarily the result of changes in the level of arbitrage activity in the market, with mutual fund competition appearing to play a secondary role. We find no evidence that the declines are the result of data snooping or learning by investors or fund managers. Finally, we show that corporate bond fund performance exhibits similar dependence on measures of bond market arbitrage activity.","We consider a model in which the correlation between shocks to consumption and to expected future consumption growth is nonzero and varies over time. We validate this assumption empirically using the model’s implication that time-variation in consumption growth persistence drives the correlation between stock and bond returns. Consistent with model predictions, we find that the stock/bond correlation is also related to the volatility of stock returns, the so-called stock market “leverage effect,” and the predictive relation between bond yields and future stock returns.",,

We show that founders' connections to early-stage investors through shared education networks are more important than school academic quality or shared geography in facilitating access to funding. Early-stage investors tilt their portfolios toward startups from their alma mater and place larger bets on these firms. Connected investments outperform the same investors' non-connected investments.

However, publishing outside the top-ranked journals is rewarded differently across fields, and the rewards are significantly lower in finance for publication outside of the “Top-3”(JF, JFE, RFS).

The lower probability of a top publication in finance raises their marginal value, leading to a higher average compensation structure. Opportunity costs of academic finance (versus finance industry), are also larger than those of other departments.","We study the effect of competition on firm innovation at the product level. We instrument shocks to competition in therapeutic areas with the FDA’s breakthrough designation therapy (BTD) indication. BTDs strongly associate with several indicators of future success, including announcement returns and eventual FDA approval to market the drug. BTD shocks discourage rivals’ innovation in that therapeutic area. The effect varies with the ex-ante competitiveness of the therapeutic area, as well as with the rival’s position (leader vs. follower) in that area, in a manner consistent with the theory by Aghion et al.(2005).",,

We demonstrate that implied equity duration is also useful for analyzing the sensitivity of equity prices to pandemic shutdowns. Pandemic shutdowns primarily impact short‐term cash flows, thus they have a greater impact on low‐duration equities. We show that implied equity duration has a strong positive relation to U.S. equity returns and analyst forecast revisions during the onset of the 2020 COVID‐19 shutdown. Our analysis also demonstrates that the underperformance of “value” stocks during this period is a rational response to their lower durations.","We provide a new explanation for the profitability anomaly along with a battery of supportive empirical tests. Our explanation is based on the observation that investors frequently value stocks by assigning similar price-to-earnings multiples to stocks with similar expected firm growth. This naive approach to valuation results in a positive relation between profitability and future stock returns, and the relation is stronger in firms with higher growth. The relation arises because less profitable firms must issue additional equity in the future to finance growth, thus diluting the claims of existing stockholders to future earnings and cash flows.","Chordia and Miao (2020) provide evidence that low-latency trading (LLT) improves the long-term informational efficiency of stock prices. This discussion raises two primary concerns with their analysis. First, the mechanism through which LLT enhances long-term efficiency is unclear. Second, CM's measure of LLT trading activity is correlated with non-LLT trading activity, which may in turn cause the documented improvements in efficiency. We close by proposing an alternative explanation—changes in market microstructure have had a bifurcated impact on liquidity, enhancing efficiency for large and liquid stocks, but not for small and illiquid stocks.",,
Mani,Sethuraman,Cornell University,Accounting,No,"Management Communication, Debt Markets","We provide evidence that a firm’s investor base is a key factor in determining its media coverage. Using a large sample of US public companies spanning the period 2000-2019, we find that firm-specific media coverage is negatively associated with leverage. Our results suggest the media caters relatively more to equity investors, who largely rely on public information, than to debt investors, who are often privy to privileged information. We arrive at similar conclusions when we exploit plausibly exogenous changes in investor base and investor access to privileged information. Among debt investors, the media appears to cater to public bond holders more than private banks. Among equity investors, the media appears to cater to quasi-index institutions. Additionally, cross-sectional variation in media coverage based on investment and article types reveals that the media’s role is far more nuanced than previously documented. Overall, our findings suggest that financial media coverage is significantly influenced by less sophisticated professional investors’ demand for information to help monitor firms.","We uncover a tone transmission channel of monetary policy wherein the linguistic tone of press releases by the Fed shapes the linguistic tone of macro-related dialogues in corporate conference calls occurring days after such releases. Applying machine-learning techniques to a granular dataset of dialogues between managers and equity analysts during conference calls, we find that the tone of macro-related dialogues is reflected in both contemporaneous stock market reactions as well as subsequent equity analysts' stock recommendations. Critically, the semantic content of monetary policy releases is consistently observed in macro dialogues between managers and analysts. A large sample analysis suggests that the effect of monetary policy tone on corporate conference calls is stronger in more recent years and for major unconventional monetary policy announcements. Taken together, our results shed light on how economic agents interpret"" Fed Speak,''underscoring non-transitory effects of monetary policy communication.","We study whether relative power in the chief executive officer (CEO)–chief financial officer (CFO) relationship influences CEO compensation. To operationalize relative power of a CEO over a CFO, we define CFO co-option as the appointment of a CFO after a CEO assumes office. We find that CFO co-option is associated with a CEO pay premium of about 10%, which is concentrated more in the early years of the co-opted CFO’s tenure and in components of compensation that vary with the achievement of analyst-based earnings targets. Our evidence also indicates that a primary channel through which CEO power over a co-opted CFO yields the achievement of earnings targets is the use of earnings management to inflate earnings. Co-opted CFOs rely primarily on using discretionary accruals to manage earnings prior to the Sarbanes–Oxley regulatory intervention and switch to real-activities manipulation afterward. The evidence thus suggests that the form of earnings management depends on costs imposed on the CFO to inflate earnings.",,

We also discuss HNV's findings in relation to research beyond accounting, including the literature on aggregate return prediction and mergers and acquisitions. Our discussion draws parallels between HNV's results and prior empirical evidence pertaining to aggregate investment and merger waves and identifies several puzzling inconsistencies. These inconsistencies highlight the lack of a clearly specified mechanism behind the return-predictive ability of aggregate M&A accruals. Finally, we point out the challenges posed by the small sample size and noisy measures of M&A accruals that may affect HNV's inferences. We conclude by suggesting several directions for future research.","We examine the link between product life cycles and disclosure using a novel 4-stage text-based life cycle model and report two main results.

These results obtain across a wide array of disclosure policies and in a quasi natural experiment.

Mario,Milone,UC San Diego,Accounting,No,,"This paper shows that a data-based screening technology can increase the cost of financial intermediation. The use of data in the screening process reduces the acquisition of soft information by traditional lenders, which harms constrained borrowers further. Additionally, groups in which fewer borrowers were financed in the past are under-represented in the data, leading to a cross-sectional difference in screening efficiency. Screening is more efficient for borrowers with greater historical lending data. When traditional and technological lenders coexist, the borrowers about whom data can provide precise information raise funds from technological lenders while those with less informative historical data choose traditional lenders who can make up for the lack of hard data-based information by acquiring soft information. The intermediation cost is increased by the existence of technological lenders. I identify conditions under which traditional lenders benefit from restricting their own access to data-processing technology when competing against the technological lender.","Trading frictions due to inevitable transportation costs are fundamentally different from those due to rent extraction by transit countries. We propose a theoretical and empirical methodology to disentangle these two types of costs and assess the presence and global magnitude of a hold-up problem. We construct a new measure of distance based on a global network of the most likely trade routes. While transportation costs make all countries worse off, rent extraction benefits transit countries. Further, we show that in general equilibrium, countries that are neither landlocked nor transit countries bear a large share of the cost of distortions due to rent extraction. While free trade agreements with transit countries do not appear to mitigate the problem, customs unions do.","In addition to risky loans, banks hold risky securities that provide uncertain future liquidity. This leads them to choose an asset structure with their desired correlation between liquidity and long term asset returns. We show that liquidity management and risk management concerns lead to a trade-off that creates an inverse relationship between security holdings and aggregate asset risk. Capital requirements mitigate liquidity risk in all future states of the world, thereby reducing the cost of liquidity risk and leading banks to increase aggregate asset risk. Liquidity requirements such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) affect high liquidity shock states and mitigate aggregate asset risk-taking. These results highlight the tension between capital and liquidity regulations in addressing the risk taking incentives of financial intermediaries.",,

We document substantial costs of dishonesty and the failure of traditional market signaling mechanisms such as auditor or underwriter quality. We also show a return of Chinese firms after US and Chinese regulatory intervention in 2013 although this intervention was insufficient to fundamentally change the character of this market. Importantly, we find that factors capturing ex post settling up costs such as North America sales and CEO’s US education reduced the probability of financial fraud. Our results support the importance of legal and regulatory institutions as a necessary condition for properly functioning capital markets.","Akerlof’s (1970) seminal work provides a framework for a market failure and discusses the consequences of quality uncertainty.

We document this result empirically using a flexible time-varying parameter model which estimates predictive coefficients as a nonparametric function of time and explore possible explanations of this finding, including time-varying risk-premia for which we only find limited support. Conversely, pockets of return predictability are consistent with a sticky expectations model in which investors only slowly update their beliefs about a persistent component in the cash flow process.","We develop novel forecasting methods for panel data with heterogeneous parameters and examine them together with existing approaches. We conduct a systematic comparison of their predictive accuracy in settings with different cross-sectional (N) and time (T) dimensions and varying degrees of parameter heterogeneity. We investigate conditions under which panel forecasting methods can perform better than forecasts based on individual estimates and demonstrate how gains in predictive accuracy depend on the degree of parameter heterogeneity, whether heterogeneity is correlated with the regressors, the goodness of fit of the model, and, particularly, the time dimension of the data set. We propose optimal combination weights for forecasts based on pooled and individual estimates and develop a novel forecast poolability test that can be used as a pretesting tool. Through a set of Monte Carlo simulations and three empirical applications to house prices, CPI inflation, and stock returns, we show that no single forecasting approach dominates uniformly. However, forecast combination and shrinkage methods provide better overall forecasting performance and offer more attractive risk profiles compared to individual, pooled, and random effects methods.","It is rare for the forecasts of one economic forecasting model to always be more accurate than the forecasts from an alternative model. This suggests the possibility of implementing a switching strategy that chooses, at each point in time, the forecasting model that is expected to be most accurate conditional on a set of instruments that are used to track the relative accuracy of the underlying forecasts. The authors analyze the factors determining the expected gains from such a switching rule over a strategy of always using one of the underlying forecasts.

We find that earnings forecast optimism is associated with higher brokerage volume, even controlling for forecast and analyst quality, recommendations, and target prices. However, forecast accuracy is also significantly associated with higher volume. When analysts change brokerage houses, they bring trading volume with them, influencing trading volume at the new brokerage. This indicates that analysts drive the volume effects we observe. Consistent with a reward for generating volume, brokerage houses are less likely to demote analysts who generate more volume. Finally, analysts strategically adjust forecast optimism based on expected volume impact. Analysts become more (less) optimistic if their optimistic forecasts in the prior year were more (less) successful at generating volume. However, consistent with higher costs to increasing accuracy, analysts do not update accuracy based on expected volume impact. Overall, our results are consistent with a brokerage trading volume conflict of interest moving analysts towards more optimistic earnings forecasts, despite the volume reward for accuracy.","Using comment streams on Seeking Alpha articles, we examine whether interacting on social media increases or moderates the extremeness of investors’ opinions. We exploit machine learning based text analysis algorithms to classify not just the direction of opinion expressed in a given comment, but how extreme it is. Unlike findings from political science, which show online interaction increasing extremeness, we find that in the context of analyzing companies and stocks, online interaction moderates extremeness. Both in terms of directional extremeness, and extremeness of language used, comments become less extreme over the sequence of comments for a given article, within individual comment sub-threads, and over a single user’s comments for a given article. Extremeness moderation occurs both following earnings announcements and during non-earnings-announcement windows. Additional analyses provide insights as to what factors might drive extremeness-moderation. Extremeness reduction is strongest when users are selfidentified (ie, not anonymous), and when the article users are commenting on is more moderate. Finally, results suggest that the extremeness reduction triggered by Seeking Alpha articles has market implications. Market-based differences of opinion measures decrease significantly after Seeking Alpha articles, but not after matched non-article days, analyst forecast days, or news article days.

However, the decision making behind the halt remains a “mystery”(WSJ, 2018). We investigate how exchanges use discretion and whether the discretion alters the effectiveness of the halts. We show halts reflect the preferences of listed firms rather than the stated exchange objectives (ie, minimizing excess volatility and off-equilibrium trades). Furthermore, when exchanges exercise more discretion (unexplained by firm and information characteristics) the halts are less effective.","We investigate executive employment gaps (hereafter, gaps) between the appointment of an external CEO at a public firm and the individual's prior executive position at a public company. These gaps cannot be reliably obtained from common databases. We hand-collect data for externally hired CEOs at public companies from 1992 to 2014. These CEOs represent approximately 40% of the 5,095 CEO successions and have a mean gap of 1.9 years. The gap increases to 3.2 years for the subset of new hires with a gap. We hypothesize that labor market frictions and executive skill sets contribute to the existence and length of these gaps. Using theories from labor economics, we predict (equilibrium) associations between two measures of “fit” (executive compensation and long-term match quality) and gaps (both existence and length).

We also find a reduction in abnormal trade volume and idiosyncratic return volatility following the publication of a fake article for these firms. Furthermore, analyses using a bunching identification strategy find that fake news production peaks prior to earnings announcements and drops upon announcement, providing evidence that impending accounting information releases induce fake news authors to avoid publishing post-disclosure when the accounting information environment is relatively stronger.

Our analyses exploit voter-level stock market ownership to provide evidence on the impact corporate earnings news has on voter perceptions and behavior. For the five most recent US presidential elections, we show that earnings news released by S&P 500 firms prior to Election Day has a statistically and economically significant impact on the likelihood that stock-owning voters will cast an incumbent vote. We conclude that corporate earnings announcements serve as a timely and relevant signal influencing voter perceptions of economic performance at a critical time in the election cycle. In addition, our findings suggest that firms with a September 30th fiscal quarter-end may have a disproportionate impact on voters’ behavior on Election Day.","Using an hourly dataset on retail investor security positions from Robinhood Markets, we find that ESG disclosures are irrelevant to retail investors’ portfolio allocation decisions. The response to ESG press releases by retail investors is no different than the routine portfolio adjustments that occur on non-event days. In contrast, these same investors make economically meaningful changes to their portfolios in response to press releases that do not pertain to ESG, especially those that pertain to earnings announcements. Our findings are not due to a lack of statistical power or other data shortcomings. Our conclusions contrast with evidence from experimental studies that retail investors respond favorably to ESG disclosures. In addition, while prior ESG studies have generally viewed investors as a single homogeneous group, our findings suggest that it is important to distinguish between retail and institutional investors.",,
Yu Ting Forester,Wong,USC,Accounting,No,,"We investigate how board oversight of U.S. banks has changed since the 2008 financial crisis. We review several expert reports that investigated the crisis to identify key board oversight deficiencies and group them into four categories: (i) lack of enterprise risk management, (ii) lack of risk awareness on the board, (iii) group think among bank directors and (iv) busy directors, especially the chairperson. Our empirical analysis examines improvements, if any, in each of these categories for 95 U.S. banks post-crisis (2008-2015), relative to the pre-crisis period (2000-2007). We find significant structural improvements to the banks’ enterprise risk management structure. Virtually every bank now has a Chief Risk Officer (CRO), and the number of banks with an independent risk committee and a committee devoted to reputation management has also increased significantly. With respect to risk awareness, we find that newly appointed bank directors are much more likely to have prior risk management, banking and specialty finance experience. There are also significantly more risk-related discussions within the financial statements, which indicate a heightened level of risk awareness. With respect to group think and busy board members, we find mixed evidence of progress. We document greater gender diversity and more empowered corporate governance and nominating committee after the crisis. In sum, at least some aspects of bank boards appear to have responded to the financial crisis.","We use novel satellite data that track the number of cars in the parking lots of 92,668 stores for 71 publicly listed U.S. retailers to study the local information advantage of institutional investors. We establish car counts as a timely measure of store-level performance and find that institutional investors adjust their holdings in response to the performance of local stores, and that these trades are profitable on average. These results suggest that local investors have an advantage when processing information about nearby operations. However, some institutional investors do not adjust for the quality of their local information and continue to rely on local signals even when they are poor predictors of firm performance and returns. This overreliance on poor local information is reduced for institutional investors with greater industry expertise and those with greater incentives to maximize short-term trading profits.","We study the sources of demand for accounting comparability. We hypothesize that U.S. investors

U.S. comparability) and (ii) comparability to other foreign firms which the investor is interested
in investing in (which we label as regional comparability). The findings in prior literature
examining U.S. institutional investors are consistent with channel (i). We explore unsponsored
ADRs as a setting where we expect channel (ii) to be particularly important. We find that regional
(but not U.S.) comparability increases the ex-ante likelihood that a depository bank selects a
foreign firm for the creation of unsponsored ADRs, and the ex-post trading in the unsponsored

Ricardo,De la O,USC,Finance,No,behavioral asset pricing,"Using survey forecasts, we find that systematic errors in expectations of long-term inflation and short-term nominal earnings growth are the main driver of prices and return puzzles for bonds and stocks. We demonstrate this by deriving and testing a single necessary and sufficient condition based on accounting identities. Errors in expectations of short-term inflation and long-term nominal earnings growth do not play a role in either asset market. Because of these systematic errors, real cash flow expectations closely match aggregate bond and stock prices, leaving little room for time-varying discount rates. These expectations also accurately match key return puzzles for bonds and stocks: the rejection of the expectations hypothesis and stock return predictability. These results are consistent with a simple model in which agents believe the persistences of inflation and nominal earnings growth are magnified versions of the objective persistences.","Why do stock prices vary? Using survey forecasts, we find that cash flow growth expectations explain most movements in the S&P 500 price‐dividend and price‐earnings ratios, accounting for at least 93% and 63% of their variation. These expectations comove strongly with price ratios, even when price ratios do not predict future cash flow growth. In comparison, return expectations have low volatility and small comovement with price ratios. Short‐term, rather than long‐term, expectations account for most price ratio variation. We propose an asset pricing model with beliefs about earnings growth reversal that accurately replicates these cash flow growth expectations and dynamics.","This work presents a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of segmented labor markets with informality assuming different levels of price rigidity in the goods market. By modeling firm-specific capital and adjustment
costs for the formal sector and a matching Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides
environment, the model can account for the countercyclical behavior of informality under both demand and cost shocks. Any increase in aggregate
income affects the informal sector in two ways: a) households decrease their
demand for informal goods as they shift towards formal goods, and b) formal firms increase their labor demand attracting workers from the informal
sector. In addition, this study also considers the design of monetary policy
in the presence of informality. It is shown that if the monetary authority
reacts to general inflation in the interest-rate rule, informality significantly
reduces the possibility of multiple equilibria emerging under the Taylor principle. However, if the central bank responds only to formal sector inflation,
this result is sharply reversed.",,
Lukas,Schmid,USC,Finance,No,,"This paper examines whether the relatedness of populations across the world shapes international trade flows. Using data on common ancestry for 172 countries covering more than 99% of global trade, we document that country pairs with weaker ancestral relationships are less likely to trade with each other (extensive margin) and, if they do trade, they exchange fewer goods and smaller volumes (intensive margin). The effect of ancestry is robust to a vast array of micro-geographic control variables and mitigated, yet still sizable and significant, when controlling for other measures of cultural distance as well as for current migrant stocks.","We estimate an equilibrium demand-based corporate bond pricing model linking institutional holdings to bond characteristics. Our estimates show heterogeneity in demand elasticities across institutions, with elastic mutual funds demanding liquidity, akin to reaching for yield, and inelastic insurance companies. Moreover, we document stark differences in preferences for maturity, credit risk, and liquidity across institutions. In counterfactuals, we evaluate the pricing implications of credit quality migration, mutual fund fragility, monetary policy tightening, and a tapering of the Fed’s corporate credit facility. Our model predicts substantial disruptions in bond prices through shifts in institutional demand and identifies the composition of institutional demand as an important state variable for corporate bond pricing.","Rising inflation in the wake of unprecedented debt financed stimulus packages raises concerns about a looming return of persistent inflation, as governments may be tempted to monetize debt. In this paper, we ask whether governments can use real (TIPS) bonds as part of the government debt portfolio to commit not to create elevated inflation? We thus examine optimal debt management in a setting where (i) the government can issue long-term nominal and real bonds,(ii) the monetary authority sets short-term interest rates according to a Taylor rule, and (iii) inflation has real costs as prices are sticky. Nominal debt can be inflated away giving ex-ante flexibility, but real bonds constitute a real commitment ex-post. We show that the optimal government debt portfolio includes a substantial allocation to both real and nominal bonds, which lowers inflation levels but increases inflation volatility in equilibrium. The associated lower correlation between inflation risk and government expenditure is reflected in welfare gains through real debt management. Quantitatively, our results are stronger i) the higher the initial debt level, and ii) the longer debt maturity. Our findings suggest that TIPS should be an important tool for debt management in the presence of looming inflation.",,
Shelley,Li,USC,Accounting,No,"Social networks, information sharing technologies, managerial accounting, etc.","Staggered boards (SBs) are one of the most potent common entrenchment devices, and their value
effects are considerably debated. We study SBs’ effects on firm value, managerial behavior, and
investor composition using a quasi-experimental setting: a 1990 law that imposed SBs on all
Massachusetts-incorporated firms. We find that relative to a matched control group of companies, for
treated companies the law led to an increase in Tobin’s Q, investment in capital expenditures and
R&D, patents, and higher-quality patented innovations, resulting in higher profitability. These effects
are concentrated in innovating firms, especially those facing greater Wall Street scrutiny. An increase
in institutional and dedicated investors also accompanied the imposition of SBs, facilitating a longerterm orientation. The evidence suggests that SBs can benefit early-life-cycle firms facing high information asymmetries by allowing their managers to focus on long-term investments and innovations.","Innovation is difficult to measure and contract on. Motivating innovation in the presence of easier-to-measure execution tasks presents a basic management control problem for many organizations. This paper examines, at the employee level, the relationship between looser management control on execution tasks (measured as reduced time pressure on these tasks) and the probability of self-initiated innovation. Using detailed project- and employee-level data from a software company, I find that reduced time pressure on execution tasks is significantly associated with a greater probability of self-initiated innovation. Consistent with theories on employee selection and relational contracts, the above effect is more pronounced (1) for employees without significantly negative outcomes on past execution tasks, (2) for employees with a greater preexisting propensity to innovate, or (3) when the employee’s supervisor has a history of working with innovating employees. Conditional on submitting innovation prototypes, reduced time pressure on execution tasks is also significantly associated with higher-quality innovation. Collectively, these findings suggest that, in a multitasking environment, management control choices for non-innovation tasks could play an important role in enabling innovation.","Many service organizations rely on information sharing systems to boost employee creativity to
meet customer needs. We conducted a field experiment in a retail chain, based on a registered
report accepted by JAR, to test whether an information sharing system recording employees’
creative work affected the quality of creative work, job engagement, and financial performance.
We found that, on average, this system did not have a significant effect on any outcomes. However,
it significantly improved the quality of creative work in stores that had accessed the system more
frequently and in stores with fewer same-company nearby stores. It also improved creative work
and job engagement in stores in divergent markets, where customers needed more customization.
We found weak evidence of better financial results where salespeople had lower creative talent
before the system was introduced. Our findings shed light on those conditions in which information
sharing systems affect employees’ creative work.",,

We document the risks disclosed by funds and how they relate to academic risk factors. We then evaluate the relevance, conciseness and order of the risk disclosures. We find that disclosed risks explain about 50% of variations in fund returns; funds tend to overdisclose by reporting insignificant risks; the order of disclosure does not imply importance. We also find that funds improve their disclosure relevance after receiving SEC comment letters. We further explore the implications of risk disclosure for flow, risk taking and performance.","This paper studies the role of technological sophistication in Initial Coin Offering (ICO) successes and valuations. Using various machine learning methods, we construct technology indexes from ICO whitepapers to capture technological sophistication for all cryptocurrencies.

Moreover, the technology indexes strongly and positively predict the long-run performances of the ICOs. Overall, the results suggest that technological sophistication is an important determinant of cryptocurrency valuations.","I study the implications of employee expectations for stock markets using alternative data. Employees' beliefs about their employers' business prospects predict future stock returns. A long-short portfolio based on employee expectations delivers an annualized abnormal return of 8% to 11%. The forecasting power of employee expectations is distinct from existing return predictors such as analyst forecasts, insider trading, employee satisfaction, and customer reviews. Further analysis suggests that hedge funds trade on this information because the return predictability is weaker at longer holding horizons. These results highlight the importance of alternative data in understanding stock returns and market efficiency in the information age.",,

We develop a model in which entrants face lower costs than incumbents in adopting new production technologies. Regulation raises the operating cost of current technology more than new technologies and thereby encourages entry. Using establishment-level data, we find supporting evidence that when industry regulation is more intense, entrants use more advanced technologies, spend less on regulation, and survive longer, as compared to incumbents.","Do investment tax incentives improve job prospects for workers? We explore states' adoption of a major federal tax incentive that accelerates the depreciation of equipment investments for eligible firms but not for ineligible ones. Analyzing massive establishment‐level data sets on occupational employment and computer investment, we find that when states expand investment incentives, eligible firms immediately increase their equipment and skilled employees; whereas they reduce routine‐task employees after a delay of up to two years. These opposing effects constitute an overall insignificant effect on the firms' total employment and shed light on the nuances of job creation through investment incentives.","This paper studies the asset pricing implications of a firm's opportunities to replace routine‐task labor with automation. I develop a model in which firms optimally undertake such replacement when their productivity is low. Hence, firms with routine‐task labor maintain a replacement option that hedges their value against unfavorable macroeconomic shocks and lowers their expected returns. Using establishment‐level occupational data, I construct a measure of firms' share of routine‐task labor.

Investors discuss their strategies and convert others to their strategies with a probability that increases in investment returns. The conversion rate is shown to be convex in realized returns. Unconditionally, active strategies (e.g., high variance and skewness) dominate, although investors have no inherent preference for these characteristics. The model has strong predictions for how the adoption of active strategies depends on investors’ social networks. In contrast with nonsocial approaches, sociability, self-enhancing transmission, and other features of the communication process determine the popularity and pricing of active investment strategies.","Using social network data from Facebook, we show that earnings announcements made by firms located in counties with higher investor social network centrality attract more attention from both retail and institutional investors. For such firms, the immediate price and volume reactions to earnings announcements are stronger, and post-announcement drift is weaker. Such firms have lower post-announcement persistence of return volatility but higher persistence in investor attention and trading volume. These effects are stronger for small firms, firms with poor analyst and media coverage, and for stocks with salient returns. Our evidence suggests a dual role of social networks---they facilitate the incorporation of public information into prices, but also trigger persistent excessive trading.","We test how market overvaluation affects corporate innovation. Estimated stock overvaluation is strongly associated with measures of innovative inventiveness (novelty, originality, and scope), as well as research and development (R&D) and innovative output (patent and citation counts). Misvaluation affects R&D more via a nonequity channel than via equity issuance. The sensitivity of innovative inventiveness to misvaluation increases with share turnover and overvaluation. The frequency of exceptionally high innovative inputs/outputs increases with overvaluation. This evidence suggests that market overvaluation may generate social value by increasing innovative output and encouraging firms to engage in “moon shots.”",,
Matthew,Shaffer,USC,Accounting,No,Valuation; M&A,"In recent decades, M&A advisors have primarily and increasingly used enterprise-value (EV) multiples in the valuations they provide to directors and shareholders as benchmarks for valuing their shares. This contrasts with equity analysts, who predominantly use direct equity-value multiples (especially, price-to-adjusted-earnings). We find that advisors’ use of EV multiples is not systematically driven by the target’s capital structure, but is driven by non-recurring items in its most recent income statement. This indicates that the valuation numerator follows the choice of value-driver denominator, and advisors move up the income statement for smoother metrics, with more “non-GAAP exclusions.” (Capitalizing metrics at or above EBIT entails EV valuation for consistency.) M&A advisors almost never use explicitly “adjusted” bottom-line earnings measures. Using commonly-recognized income-statement levels like EBITDA may serve as an indirect means to the same end, while appearing less discretionary, in this litigious setting. We contribute by explaining variation in valuation practice, and identifying a novel manifestation of the broader “non GAAP” phenomenon in M&A.","Recent years have witnessed growing interest in corporate sustainability reporting. Yet existing research provides mixed and indirect evidence on the information content of such reports to investors.

Our examination focuses on reports incorporating SASB metrics that are intended to provide financially material and decision useful information to investors. Using standard measures of information content, we are unable to find compelling evidence that sustainability reports provide a significant amount of decision-useful information to investors. We conclude that sustainability information is demanded by a broad set of stakeholders who are concerned with environmental and social impacts and that a narrow focus on financial materiality to investors is unnecessarily restrictive.","This paper provides an overview of valuation multiples in M&A advisory.

For example, identical differences are observed between HBCU and non-HBCUs with AAA ratings or when insured by the same company, even before the 2007–2009 financial crisis.

Kenneth,Ahern,USC,Finance,No,"Networks, corporate finance, asset pricing","We use the price effects caused by the passage of rent control in St. Paul, Minnesota in 2021, to study the transfer of wealth across income groups. First, we find that rent control caused property values to fall by 6-7%, for an aggregate loss of $1.6 billion. Both owner-occupied and rental properties lost value, but the losses were larger for rental properties, and in neighborhoods with a higher concentration of rentals. Second, leveraging administrative parcel-level data, we find that the tenants who gained the most from rent control had higher incomes and were more likely to be white, while the owners who lost the most had lower incomes and were more likely to be minorities. For properties with high-income owners and low-income tenants, the transfer of wealth was close to zero. Thus, to the extent that rent control is intended to transfer wealth from high-income to low-income households, the realized impact of the law was the opposite of its intention.","This paper proposes a network model of the economy in which conglomerate firms transmit idiosyncratic shocks from one industry to another. The strength of inter-industry connections is determined by the conglomerate's share of total industry sales and by the industry's share of the conglomerate's total sales. The empirical results show that industry growth rates comove more strongly within industry pairs that are more closely connected in the conglomerate network. These results hold after controlling for industry-pair and year fixed effects, input-output connections, reverse causality, and in tests that exploit exogenous cross-sectional industry shocks from import tariff changes. Finally, our model also provides a new cross-industry extension for the widely-used Herfindahl index of concentration.","This paper exploits hand-collected data on illegal insider trades to provide new evidence on the ability of a host of standard measures of illiquidity to detect informed trading.

The former two themes address research questions that are more China-centric, while the third exploits the China setting to examine questions that are more universal.

We argue that the requirement for auditors to publicly disclose internal control weaknesses exacerbated auditor-client conflicts and that this resulted in auditors being less likely to detect (and correct) misstatements in their clients' pre-audit financial statements. Consistent with this argument, we find significant reductions in audit adjustments following the staggered introduction of MICAs using data from China. We find the reductions in audit adjustments are associated with significant increases in material misstatements following the introduction of MICAs. In contrast, we find that the introduction of MICAs led to a significant reduction in material misstatements among clients that did not experience reductions in audit adjustments. Overall, the two effects offset each other, which explains why financial reporting quality did not improve, on average, following the introduction of MICAs.","Standard-setters worldwide have passed new audit reporting requirements aimed at making audit reports more informative to investors. In the UK, the new standard expands the audit reporting model by requiring auditors to disclose the risks of material misstatement (RMMs) that had the greatest effect on the financial statement audit. Using short window tests, prior research indicates that these disclosures are not incrementally informative to investors (Gutierrez et al. in Review of Accounting Studies 23:1543–1587, 2018). In this study, we investigate three potential explanations for why investors do not find the additional auditor risk disclosures to be informative. First, using long-window tests, we find no evidence that the insignificant short-window market reactions are due to a delayed investor reaction to RMMs. Second, using value relevance tests, we show that the insignificant market reactions are not due to auditors disclosing irrelevant information. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that RMMs lack information content because investors were already informed about the financial reporting risks before auditors began disclosing them in expanded audit reports.",,

Mark,DeFond,USC,Accounting,No,,"During the past decade, there has been a surge in auditing research that exploits Chinese data, much of which is published in top tier journals. China has been an attractive setting for auditing research due to the highly granular nature of the available data on public audits and the unique features of Chinese institutions. These advantages have allowed researchers to use Chinese data to study important auditing questions that US data is unable to address. But the popularity of Chinese data among researchers means that most of the obvious questions that lend themselves to the use of Chinese data are likely to be exhausted. In addition, newly mandated disclosures in the US and Europe are quickly making Chinese data much less unique than it used to be. Now that the “low hanging fruit” is gone, researchers who plan to use Chinese data will have to be more creative. This paper suggests some strategies, going forward, that are designed to further exploit the richness of Chinese data to address important questions in the auditing literature.","We study the effect of fair value accounting on the association between net income and cash pay following the 2005 worldwide adoption of IFRS.

Overall, we contribute to the literature on the usefulness of fair value accounting by presenting evidence that fair value accounting is associated with a decrease in this association.

Kristi,Rennekamp,Cornell University,Accounting ,No,,"As firms increasingly use social media to provide disclosures to investors, it is important to understand whether the characteristics that are associated with these disclosures lead to different reactions from investors than disclosures provided via more traditional channels. In this paper, we use an experiment to examine whether linguistic formality in positive news disclosures, and engagement of social media users surrounding the disclosures (e.g., “likes” and “retweets”), affect investors' judgments about a firm and its management. Results suggest that, as predicted, investors are more sensitive to signals of audience engagement when disclosures use informal rather than formal language. Specifically, when associated with signals of high audience engagement, the use of informal language leads to greater willingness to invest than the use of formal language in a disclosure. However, also as predicted, the use of informal language hurts willingness to invest when associated with signals of low audience engagement. In two follow-up experiments, we investigate how news valence and linguistic formality are expected to affect the level of audience engagement in the first place, and we investigate whether managers strategically vary their use of linguistic formality based on characteristics of the setting. Overall, our results provide evidence on how firms might use social media disclosures to better connect with investors. This study contributes to the growing literature on linguistic attributes of disclosures, and the emerging literature investigating the consequences of issuing financial disclosures through social media.","We examine how information dissemination via mobile device applications (apps) affects nonprofessional investors' judgments. In response to the prevalence of mobile device use, the media ungroups content into smaller pieces to accommodate users, and apps use push notifications to highlight this content. These changes increase users' ability to access investment information in real time, leaving some investors feeling as if they are missing out if they are not continuously connected. We validate a scale to capture investors' fear of missing out on investment information (I-FoMO) and document that I-FoMO is distinct from traditional FoMO that occurs in social settings. Then, using an experiment, we find that receiving ungrouped content via a mobile device has a greater effect on investment allocations in the presence, rather than absence, of push notifications. Further, we find that these results hold for higher, but not for lower, I-FoMO investors.","Research on conference calls documents that the question and answer (Q&A) portion is informative to markets.

Using an experiment, we first demonstrate that linguistic style matching (LSM), a form of verbal coordination, is a reasonable empirical proxy for conversational engagement. We next use a quasi-experiment to confirm that investors can detect differences in engagement. Finally, using a hand-collected archival dataset comprised of audio recordings and textual transcripts from over 2400 earnings calls, we show that LSM in manager-analyst conversations during the Q&A is positively associated with absolute stock returns during the conversation, suggesting that conversations with greater engagement are more informative to capital markets and facilitate price formation.",,

In view of this projection, we consider some implications of home internet access quality, exploiting data from the new Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes. Moving to high-quality, fully reliable home internet service for all Americans ('universal access') would raise earnings-weighted labor productivity by an estimated 1.1% in the coming years. The implied output gains are $160 billion per year, or $4 trillion when capitalized at a 4% rate. Estimated flow output payoffs to universal access are nearly three times as large in economic disasters like the COVID-19 pandemic. Our survey data also say that subjective well-being was higher during the pandemic for people with better home internet service conditional on age, employment status, earnings, working arrangements, and other controls. In short, universal access would raise productivity, and it would promote greater economic and social resilience during future disasters that inhibit travel and in-person interactions.","No previous infectious disease outbreak, including the Spanish Flu, has affected the stock market as forcefully as the COVID-19 pandemic.

We use a novel identification strategy, instrumenting firm-level AI investments with firms' ex-ante exposure, based on alumni networks, to the supply of AI-skilled labor from universities historically strong in AI research. The positive growth effect of AI comes primarily through increased product innovation, reflected in trademarks, product patents, and updates to product portfolios. AI-powered growth concentrates among the ex-ante largest firms, leading to higher industry concentration and reinforcing winner-take-most dynamics. Our results highlight that new technologies can contribute to growth through product innovation.","How does artificial intelligence (AI) impact audit quality and efficiency? We explore this question by leveraging a unique dataset of more than 310,000 detailed individual resumes for the 36 largest audit firms to identify audit firms’ employment of AI workers.

Importantly, AI is a centralized function within the firm, with workers concentrating in a handful of teams and geographic locations. Our results show that investing in AI helps improve audit quality, reduces fees, and ultimately displaces human auditors, although the effect on labor takes several years to materialize. Specifically, a one-standard-deviation change in recent AI investments is associated with a 5.0% reduction in the likelihood of an audit restatement, a 0.009 drop in log per client fees, and a reduction in the number of accounting employees that reaches 3.6% after three years and 7.1% after four years.","What drives the persistent puzzle of market reactions to old news?

To evaluate the market implications of this mechanism, we exploit a unique dataset of 17 million news articles from the Bloomberg terminal. Recombination of old information prompts larger price moves and subsequent reversals than direct reprints of old news. Furthermore, while overall reactions to old information have declined over time, differential reactions to recombinations have risen.",,
Wenhao,Li,USC,Finance,No,"Financial Intermediation, Asset Pricing","Bank-created money, shadow-bank money, and Treasury bonds all satisfy investors' demand for a liquid transaction medium and safe store of value. We measure the quantity of these three forms of liquidity and their corresponding liquidity premium over a sample from 1934 to 2016. We empirically examine the links between these different assets, estimating the extent to which they are substitutes, and the amount of liquidity per unit delivered by each asset. Treasury bonds and bank deposits are imperfect substitutes, in contrast to the findings of perfect substitutes of Nagel (2016). This result is directly relevant to the monetary transmission mechanism running through shifts in asset supplies, such as quantitative easing policies. Our results on the imperfect substitutability of bank and shadow-bank money also inform analyses of the coexistence of the shadow-banking and regulated banking system. We construct a new broad monetary aggregate based on our estimates and show that it helps resolve the money-demand instability and missing-money puzzles of the monetary economics literature.","In crises, low-quality firms face greater financial shortfalls and invest less than high-quality firms. Public liquidity support preserves the overall production capacity but dampens the cleansing effects of crises on firm quality. The trade-off between quantity and quality determines the optimal size of intervention. Policy distortions are self-perpetuating: A downward bias in quality necessitates interventions of greater scales in future crises. Distortions are amplified by low-quality firms’ expectations of liquidity support and overinvestment pre-crisis. Finally, the optimal intervention is larger and distortionary effects stronger in a low interest rate environment where low yields on precautionary savings discourage firms from self-insurance.","We develop a model of financial crises with both a financial amplification mechanism, via frictional intermediation, and a role for sentiment, via time-varying beliefs about an illiquidity state. We confront the model with data on credit spreads, equity prices, credit, and output across the financial crisis cycle. In particular, we ask the model to match data on the frothy pre-crisis behavior of asset markets and credit, the sharp transition to a crisis where asset values fall, disintermediation occurs and output falls, and the post-crisis period characterized by a slow recovery in output. Our model with the frictional intermediation mechanism and fluctuations in beliefs provides a parsimonious account of the entire crisis cycle. The model with only the frictional intermediation mechanism misses the frothy pre-crisis behavior; fluctuations in beliefs resolve this problem. On the other hand, modeling the belief variation via either a Bayesian or diagnostic model match the broad patterns, with each missing some targets to different extents. We also show that a lean-against-the-wind policy has a quantitatively similar impact in both versions of the belief model, indicating that policy need not “get into the minds” of investors and condition on the true belief process.",,
